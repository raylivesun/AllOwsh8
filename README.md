The term "AllOwnsh8" appears to be a typo or a misspelling. It does not resemble any known programming language syntax or command. If you are referring to a specific code or command, please provide more context or clarify the term. If you are looking for a code snippet related to ownership in programming, here's an example in Rust:

```java
// Define a struct to represent ownership
struct MyStruct {
    data: i32,
}

fn main() {
    // Create an instance of MyStruct
    let my_instance = MyStruct { data: 42 };

    // Move ownership of my_instance to another variable
    let another_instance = my_instance;

    // Attempting to use my_instance after moving ownership will result in a compile error
    // println!("my_instance.data = {}", my_instance.data);
}
```
In this example, my_instance is moved to another_instance using the assignment operator, which transfers ownership. After the move, my_instance is no longer valid and cannot be used.
